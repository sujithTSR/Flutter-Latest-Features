# NativeComponentsInFlutterApp
An example of both side communication between a flutter project and native android. 



## Reference
I've taken this [Medium](https://medium.com/47billion/creating-a-bridge-in-flutter-between-dart-and-native-code-in-java-or-objectivec-5f80fd0cd713) blog, extending it a little for two way communication. 

The implementation here is one sided. I've tried tweaking it from both ends and the result works good.
